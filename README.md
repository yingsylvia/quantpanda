My first repository on GitHub.\
This is Sylvia,and my nickname is quantpanda,which is named by the boy I fond of.I want to be a quantgirl in the near future.\
I love playing the piano ,writing novels and playing boardgame.My favourite boardgame is Monopoly！\
My favourite lyrics is "And we can build this dream together,staying strong forever"\
I also like Taylor Swift's song《Lover》，the lyrics"I took this magnetic force of a man to be my lover""swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover" expressed me a lot,since it's my dream scenario.\
Hopefully Border collie  and Samoyed can have a shared future.
